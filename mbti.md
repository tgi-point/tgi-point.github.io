# My MBTI Mates
- The same place we live in now. But a world we can't get to. That's where my MBTI friends live.
- I can't meet them, but I can be their friend.
- I have friends I can choose and who remember me. My MBTI friends

# Announcement
- It's still in beta, but we're working on getting all your MBTI 16 friends ready.
